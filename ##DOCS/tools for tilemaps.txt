To create a tileset:

create a 256 x 255 x 256 png containig the tileset.

Render it in wingrit to binary to get your pal and img file. 
Even as you will throw it awy later, build a map an check of all 
map reduction! (And delete the map afterwards). If you don't do this
grit will optimize your tileset resulting in some garbled tiles in
the game.

Rename the files to yourfile_pal.bin and yourfile_tiles.bin


Open Tiled.

Create a new project. (Map format: csv!!)

Load the before mentioned png file as tileset.

Build your map using up to 4 layers. (Additional layers can be processed
									  but NDS can only use up to four)
									  
Use tmx2bin to convert tiled map to nds binary format.
